## 🔧 Technical Details

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose | Status |
|----------|--------|---------|--------|
| `/` | GET | API information | ✅ Working |
| `/health` | GET | Health check | ✅ Working |
| `/tutor/stream/{id}` | POST | Start streaming session | ✅ Working |
| `/tutor/resume/{id}` | POST | Resume with response | ✅ Working |
| `/tutor/state/{id}` | GET | Get session state | ✅ Working |
| `/tutor/session/{id}` | DELETE | Delete session | ✅ Working |

### Event Types

| Event | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `session_started` | Session initialization | ✅ |
| `llm_token` | Real-time LLM token | ✅ |
| `node_complete` | Node finished | ✅ |
| `checkpoint` | State checkpoint | ✅ |
| `interrupt` | User input required | ✅ |
| `error` | Error occurred | ✅ |
| `stream_complete` | Streaming finished | ✅ |

### Key Innovation: Serialization Solution

**Problem**: LangChain `BaseMessage` objects aren't JSON serializable

**Solution**:
```python
def serialize_for_sse(obj):
    if isinstance(obj, BaseMessage):
        return obj.model_dump()  # Pydantic's built-in method
    elif isinstance(obj, dict):
        return {k: serialize_for_sse(v) for k, v in obj.items()}
    elif isinstance(obj, (list, tuple)):
        return [serialize_for_sse(item) for item in obj]
    # ... handle other types
    else:
        return obj
```

**Why it works**:
- Uses Pydantic's official serialization method
- Recursive to handle nested structures
- Clean pre-processing before `json.dumps()`
- Handles all message types automatically
